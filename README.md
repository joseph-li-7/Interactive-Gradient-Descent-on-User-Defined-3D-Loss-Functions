# Interactive-Gradient-Descent-on-User-Defined-3D-Loss-Functions

This project is an interactive tool for exploring gradient descent on functions of two variables. It lets users input any mathematical function with two inputs, then automatically calculates derivatives and performs gradient descent to find a minimum.

The goal is to build intuition about how machine learning models optimize loss functions, starting from simple math and visualization. By seeing the path of descent on a 3D surface, it connects the theory with a clear visual example, making optimization concepts easier to grasp.

The project visualizes the optimization process with two plots:
- A 2D plot showing how the loss value changes over each iteration
- A 3D surface plot showing the function's landscape and path taken by the gradient descent
This approach makes abstract concepts like loss functions, gradients, and optimization more intuitive and approachable.

Optimization is essentially the core of machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs). Understanding how gradient descent works on simple functions builds the foundation to grasp complex models. This project was created as a self-learning tool to bridge math theory with practical visualization, providing a stepping stone for my interests in ML optimization.
